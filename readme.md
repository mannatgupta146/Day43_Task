# Day 43 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains the **JavaScript Counter Project** I completed as part of **Day 42**.  
It focuses on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **dynamic styling**, and creating an **interactive counter UI** using JavaScript.

📌 **About the Day 42 Task**  
Day 42 was centered around practicing **DOM selection**, **event listeners**, **UI updates**, and building a functional counter with clean animations and styling.

✨ **Task Description**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧩 DOM Selection | Selected elements like `h1`, `+`, `-`, and `reset` using `querySelector` and `getElementById()`. |
| ➕ Increase Counter | Clicking the **+** button increments the counter value. |
| ➖ Decrease Counter | Clicking the **–** button decreases the counter value. |
| 🔄 Reset Counter | The **reset** button sets the counter back to **0**. |
| 🎨 Temporary Color Change | Buttons change color briefly using `style.backgroundColor` with `setTimeout()`. |
| 🖱️ Hover Animation | Added smooth hover scaling to enhance user experience. |
| 🎯 Centered Layout | Used Flexbox to perfectly center the entire counter component. |
| 💎 UI Styling | Added shadows, rounded corners, and clean card-style design. |

## 🎥 Demo  
Here is a preview of how the counter works:

🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **HTML** – Structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM and event logic  
- **VS Code / Browser** – Testing and debugging  


## 📖 Learning Outcome  
Through this task, I learned how to:

- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript  
- Use **event listeners** to trigger UI updates  
- Update text dynamically using `.innerHTML`  
- Apply temporary color changes using **`setTimeout()`**  
- Use **Flexbox** for perfect layout centering  
- Add hover animations and shadows for modern UI  
- Build a fully interactive component with clean structure  

This project strengthened my understanding of **events**, **DOM manipulation**, and **JavaScript-based UI design**.


## 🌟 Acknowledgement  
This task helped me improve my understanding of **JavaScript events, DOM structure, styling, and interactive UI development**.  
I am grateful for the consistent guidance and motivation that helps me grow every day.
